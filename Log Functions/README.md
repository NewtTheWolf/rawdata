## INSTALATION
### You need the Current Events and Mods from the DBM Network to use these RawDatas!
- [DBM Network Mods](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods)
- [Download Mods](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Factions)
- [Download Events](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdbm-network%2Fmods%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fevents)

You either need to download my .env file and add it to your bot folder where your bot.js file is or create one yourself and add my text to it

Everything else is explained in the .env file

You also need the "dotenv" package from NodeJS which you should also install.
```
npm i dotenv --save
```

If you want emojis to be shown in the log message you can also download the emojis, to get an ID of the emojis just use my "get_emoji_id.json" RawData
